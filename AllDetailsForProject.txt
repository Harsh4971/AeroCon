Setting up AeroCon.
Start with npm init. 
Download express and ejs.
And write the first four lines just as it is.
Also don't forget the server.listen() to listen to the project

Made a views folder to keep all the '.ejs' files (Embedded Javascript) where we can write js along with html.

app.get is used to deploy some command on entering the website
res.status(200).send("hello World") ..... used to send test to the webpage.
res.render("file") ..... is used to deploy ejs file on loading a webpage

Next I used uuid package library and v4 version of it to create a unique id for all the users or rooms.
In the line app.get("/:room"...) ..... here room is a parameter which will take the unique room id from app.get("/") which will get redirected to it.
Then '''roomId: req.params.room''' means that a variable roomId is created that will take the value of room(unique id, uuid) that is being passed to this function.

Now script.js will conatin our js for all the frontend.

Now I have used socket.io to establish a connection between me and the other person on the video chat.

Then I downloaded peer.js in my project to enable WebDTC connection to communicate
